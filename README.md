Assignment 1 Brief:
Design an algorithm using the midpoint method for scan converting the function y = x^2/20 in the range -20 ≤ x ≤ 20.
Identify the regions where the algorithm would be invoked and how symmetry could be employed to improve its efficiency.
Implement the same using OpenGL.

Assignment 2 Brief:
Create a walking robot with the given object heirarchy, out of cubes and cuboids.
Use 'f' for forward walk, 'b' for backward walk and 'w' to switch from filled to wireframe mode and 'f' for vice versa.
